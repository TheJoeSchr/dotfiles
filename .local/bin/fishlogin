#!/bin/bash -l

# Changes the current shell to fish while keeping the bash environment.
# Fish is a great shell but many CLI tools assume you use bash.
# This lets you use fish but configure your shell environment
#
# 1. Copy this file to /usr/local/bin/fishlogin
# 2. Make it executable:
# sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fishlogin
# 3. Add it to /etc/shells
# echo /usr/local/bin/fishlogin | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
# 4. Switch your login shell
# chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fishlogin $USER

# exec  replaces  the  currently  running shell with a new command. On successful completion, exec never returns.
