    " Firenvim has a setting named takeover that can be set to always, empty, never, nonempty or once. When set to always, Firenvim will always take over elements for you. When set to empty, Firenvim will only take over empty elements. When set to never, Firenvim will never automatically appear, thus forcing you to use a keyboard shortcut in order to make the Firenvim frame appear. When set to nonempty, Firenvim will only take over elements that aren't empty. When set to once, Firenvim will take over elements the first time you select them, which means that after :q'ing Firenvim, you'll have to use the keyboard shortcut to make it appear again. Here's how to use the takeover setting:
    " let fc['.*'] = { 'takeover': 'always' }
    " Don't use with rich text editors (.g. Gmail, Outlook, Slackâ€¦) as a general rule,
    let fc['.*'] = { 'takeover': 'nonempty', 'selector': 'textarea:not([readonly]), div[role="textbox"]'}
